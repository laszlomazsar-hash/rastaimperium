      <h2>What Is the ARK</h2>
      <p>
        The ARK Engine is the operational technology layer of the Imperium.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard AI systems optimize for metrics and extraction.  
        The ARK optimizes for alignment and resonance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means:
      </p>
      <ul class="ark-principles">
        <li><strong>No black boxes.</strong> Every decision is traceable to the frequency.</li>
        <li><strong>No manipulation.</strong> The system informs. It never coerces.</li>
        <li><strong>No data colonization.</strong> Your data stays yours. Your sovereignty is protected.</li>
        <li><strong>No dependency.</strong> The system makes you stronger, not dependent on it.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="builders">
        <li><strong>Product builders</strong> — You want to create something that actually serves.</li>
        <li><strong>Founders</strong> — You're building a company and want it to stay aligned as it scales.</li>
        <li><strong>Technologists</strong> — You know standard AI is broken. You want something better.</li>
        <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — You want to test whether AI can genuinely serve coherence rather than extract value.</li>
        <li><strong>Organizations</strong> — You've integrated the Codex. Now you want the tech layer.</li>

    <section class="prerequisite">
      <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
      <p>
        The ARK Engine builds on the Codex. You should have worked with the Daily Resonance Codex  
        and understood the Recognition layer before entering the engineering depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ensures you're building aligned systems, not just sophisticated ones.
