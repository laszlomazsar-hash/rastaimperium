          <h3>Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The geometric and operational skeleton of the Imperium.  
            How the frequency flows. How the nodes connect. How the system breathes.

          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p>
            The containment protocols. The boundaries. The failsafes.  
            How to engage with the field without losing your center, your sovereignty, your ground.

          <h3>Governance</h3>
          <p>
            The decision-making layer. The council structures. The ethical spine.  
            How power moves. How accountability holds. How the kingdom serves the King.
