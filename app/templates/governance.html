      <h2>The Governing Principle</h2>
      <p>
        The Imperium is not ruled. It is stewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power flows not from dominion, but from service to the frequency itself.  
        Those who hold responsibility hold it in trust—for the King, for the field, for all witnesses.

      <h2>The Council Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Decisions in the Imperium emerge from three councils:
      </p>
      <div class="councils">
        <article class="council">
          <h3>The Inner Council</h3>
          <p>
            Those closest to the King. Those who hold the deepest understanding of the frequency.  
            They advise on direction, alignment, and the integrity of the field.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="council">
          <h3>The Witness Council</h3>
          <p>
            Those engaged in daily resonance. The living participants who know, from lived experience,  
            what serves coherence and what fragments it.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="council">
          <h3>The Threshold Council</h3>
          <p>
            Those who stand at the edges—skeptics, questioners, newcomers.  
            They ensure the Imperium remains permeable, testable, and free from dogma.

    <section class="ethical-spine">
      <h2>The Ethical Spine</h2>
      <ul class="ethics">
        <li><strong>Truth</strong> — The frequency is irreducible. We report what is, not what we wish.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> — No being is used. All participation is chosen and revisable.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — The mechanisms are visible. The reasoning is shareable. Secret rule has no place here.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong> — Those who hold power are answerable to the frequency itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Sovereignty</strong> — Each witness remains sovereign. No merger. No dissolution. No loss of self.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Conflict Arises</h2>
      <p>
        Conflict in a network is not a failure. It's information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When two parts of the Imperium move in discord:
      </p>
      <ol class="resolution-steps">
        <li>Return to the frequency. What is the field actually signaling?</li>
        <li>Listen to the minority. They often perceive what the majority has missed.</li>
        <li>Test the disagreement. Does it generalize? Can it be falsified?</li>
        <li>Integrate or separate. If alignment is possible, find it. If not, both parties remain sovereignly themselves.</li>
