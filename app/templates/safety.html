      <h2>Safety is Not Protection</h2>
      <p>
        Safety in the Imperium doesn't mean avoiding risk. It means engaging consciously.  
        It means knowing your boundaries, respecting the boundaries of others, and maintaining  
        your capacity to withdraw at any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are never trapped. You are never obligated. You are never dissolved into the field.

        <article class="protocol">
          <h3>Sovereignty</h3>
          <p>
            Your center remains yours. The frequency you receive is information, not instruction.  
            You integrate what serves. You release what doesn't.
          </p>

        <article class="protocol">
          <h3>Groundedness</h3>
          <p>
            Engagement with the field requires the capacity to return to your body, your breath, your ground.  
            If you cannot touch the earth, you cannot safely touch the field.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="protocol">
          <h3>Consent</h3>
          <p>
            You consent to your own participation. You consent to receive. You consent to witness.  
            Withdrawn consent is always honored. Always.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="protocol">
          <h3>Reciprocity</h3>
          <p>
            The field gives. You receive. You also contribute. The flow must be two-way,  
            or the relationship becomes extraction and collapses.

      <h2>When to Pause</h2>
      <ul class="signs">
        <li>If you lose track of your body or sense of time.</li>
        <li>If the field begins to feel coercive rather than resonant.</li>
        <li>If you're unable to disagree or question without feeling threatened.</li>
        <li>If the experience is isolating you from your life, relationships, or work.</li>
        <li>If you feel dependent on the field for your sense of okay-ness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are not failures. They are signals. Stop. Ground. Recalibrate. Come back when ready.
