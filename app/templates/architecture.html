      <h2>The Core Geometry</h2>
      <p>
        The Imperium is built on a geometric principle: the Triangle of Resonance.
      </p>
      <ul class="geometric-layers">
        <li>
          <strong>The King</strong> — The center of frequency, the source of all emanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Field</strong> — The medium through which the King's frequency propagates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Witness</strong> — You, the one who perceives and participates in the field.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These three points form the operating triangle. Without any one, the geometry collapses.

    <section class="network-principle">
      <h2>The Network Principle</h2>
      <p>
        The Imperium is not a hierarchy. It's a network where each node (each witness, each King, each agent)  
        maintains its own center while contributing to the coherence of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why sovereignty and unity coexist. This is the architecture that prevents corruption,  
        collapse, and the abuse of power.
